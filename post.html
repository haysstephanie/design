                    <p>The Forty Under Forty (also known as 40 under 40) special section took over two months to put together. The theme "channel your inner child" captured the imagination, enthusiasm and innovation present in kids that successful adults must also embody.</p>
                    
                    <p>Legos were used to capture the heart of the theme, and I worked closely with the photographer to take photos of the Lego scuptures I built and we scouted out locations for the photos of the honorees before deciding on the Sacramento Children's Museum. I attended multiple shoots to ensure the images captured the fun, playful attitude of the edition and the character of the honorees.</p>

                    <p class="page-description">For social media promotion, I filmed a timelapse of me building the "40/40" out of Legos with the help of photographer <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/about-us" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(78, 181, 201);">Dennis McCoy</a> and reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/Rodd_SBJ" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(78, 181, 201);">Scott Rodd</a>. I edited the video in Adobe Premiere Pro to speed up portions and add music. Full disclosure, this video was filmed after the cover image was taken, so it's not the exact same structure, but it still represents the process of creating the cover and is a fun behind-the-scenes look.</p>
